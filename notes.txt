Model:

The ProductManager class can be considered the Model, as it handles the data management and operations related to products.
It loads and saves data from/to a JSON file, which serves as the data store.

View:

There is no dedicated View component in the version without Tkinter, as it is a console-based application.
The print statements and user input prompts in the Application class can be considered a primitive form of the View, as they display information to the user and gather user input.

Controller:

The Application class acts as a combination of the Controller and the View.
It handles the application flow, user interactions, and coordinates between the ProductManager (Model) and the console input/output (View).
